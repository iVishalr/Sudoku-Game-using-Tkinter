# Sudoku-Game-using-Tkinter
Sudoku Game created using Tkinter library in python. 

This is a small project on Sudoku game using GUI.


How does it work?
The user selects either easy,medium,hard or insane diffculty. Then a random problem set will be given to the user as his/her problem set. The same problem set will be solved by the computer as well. Mean while, a new problem set of the same difficulty will be added to the problem set. All these processes happens at the same time and is achieved by using multiprocessing library of python. 

When the user solves a problem, we store their score in a dataset so that we can calculate the average perfomance of all the users in that difficulty category.

Please store all the files in the same directory and then execute Sudoku.py file to run the game.

This is open to everyone. You can make changes in it and try to imporve the code.
